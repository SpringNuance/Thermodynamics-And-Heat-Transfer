HRR
Heat release rate is the function of viscosity, density, calorific value, latent heat of fuels 
and burning velocity of fuels, and combustion temperature. The heat release rate consists of premixed 
combustion, controlled combustion, and late combustion.

CHR
compression heat radiator 

IMEP
The Indicated Mean Effective Pressure is the average pressure, that induced in the 
combustion chamber during the complete thermodynamic cycle in Internal Combustion engines.

Equivalence ratio
CAD: Crank Angle Degree
BTDC: Before Top Dead Center
SOI: Start of Injection

Hello Professor Cheng, 
Right now, we are doing post-processing steps and there are many MATLAB files and folders that we found hard to keep track of. So far, there are these files:
Folder MatlabCode: having the files CHR_IMEP_Calculation, HRR_Calculation, ReadtextforLEOI and Plot_P_HRR_CHR_dP
Folder ExperimentalData(forlearning): having the files 202001091544-TriF_EngTestT1 to 202001091544-TriF_EngTestT5
Folder 20220310-Group-Project-Matfile: which is the folder you sent via Funet, having files Test_20220310_0001 to Test_20220310_0025
And finally the .m file ReadMatfile_Calculate_HRR_CHR_IMEP which calculates heat released rate, compression heat radiator and Indicated Mean Effective Pressure
At the start of this .m file, there is this line:
addpath '\\home.org.aalto.fi\chengq1\data\Desktop\Engine Study\Matlab_PostProcessing\natsortfiles' % reorder your cases
However, we do not have any files called natsortfiles at all in the folders above, and we cannot run this file. When I choose any folder, it reports an error
In ReadMatfile_Calculate_HRR_CHR_IMEP (line 1) 
Unrecognized function or variable 'natsortfiles'.

Can you please instruct us on how to set up the working environment, what we generally need to do in this post processing stage? 
And, what should we report in the end? Is it that we must fill in the three columns, Energy 1, Energy 2 and Total Energy in the Project Tasks.xlsx for the 5 tests, each test has 5 different cases? 

We look forward to hearing from you,
BR, Xuan Binh



For your questions, my answers are below:

1)	Now you donâ€™t need to care about my previous Matlab code: CHR_IMEP_Calculation, HRR_Calculation, ReadtextforLEOI and Plot_P_HRR_CHR_dP
2)	And also, Folder ExperimentalData(forlearning). Skip this folder.
3)	you should select your task in Folder 20220310-Group-Project-Matfile. Discuss with your group member, make sure everyone has a different task.
4)	You can directly get the heat release rate, cumulative heat release, indicated mean effective pressure from ReadMatfile_Calculate_HRR_CHR_IMEP.m
5)	You need to compare the difference in heat release rate with my code and Dewesoft results.
6)	And also, you need to explain how do the parameters affect the engine performances. 
7)	addpath '\\home.org.aalto.fi\chengq1\data\Desktop\Engine Study\Matlab_PostProcessing\natsortfiles' % reorder your cases. 
	Here you need to change the path to your folder which contains the [natsortfiles]folder. You need to extract it and put it somewhere. 
	Then copy the path and replace the path of this '\\home.org.aalto.fi\chengq1\data\Desktop\Engine Study\Matlab_PostProcessing\natsortfiles'
